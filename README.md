# Media Database
A fully python based media database where users can keep track of the DVDs, CDs, and games that they own.

This is a very basic database that stores data after the program quits, and can edit, delete, sort and filter items in the database.

## Whats new in Version 2
Nothing much, the database will be implemented using sqlite3 instead of a text document because a database app is a lot better suited for sql rather than a text document :roll_eyes:
